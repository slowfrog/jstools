    This project contains all the tools I currently use to make my web projects.
    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <h2>Compilation</h2>
        <p>When I start a new project, I copy sample-build.xml to my new directory, change the &lt;import&gt; location to point to build-base.xml and then list all my JavaScript source files in the property called sources. Once it's done, the only time I change it again is when I add source files. Be aware that the order of the files might be important: that's why I don't try to just compile all js files from the directory.</p>

    <p>To compile, just run <code>ant compile</code> for the standard compiler or <code>ant advanced</code> for advanced settings. The results will go respectively in a compiled/ and advanced/ directory.</p>
    
    <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>To run tests with JsTestDriver, you need to run a server, to capture some browsers and then
        launch the tests.
        Here is how I do it.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Start the server with a command like: <code>java -jar JsTestDriver-1.3.3b.jar --port 9876</code> This must be done in the directory where JsTestDriver is located, but it can be anywhere.</li>
          <li>Capture all the browsers you want by pointing them to <code>http://localhost:9876/capture</code></li>
          <li>Run the tests of your project, generally from the project directory, with <code>ant test-standard</code> when testing the original JavaScript sources, <code>ant test-compiled</code> to test the sources compiled in standard mode, or <code>ant test-advanced</code> to test the sources compiled in advanced mode.</li>
        </ol>
        
    <h1>Files</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar is a library of very useful ant tasks. Once you use them, you can't stop.</li>
      <li>closure.jar is Google's closure JavaScript compiler</li>
      <li>JsTestDriver-1.3.3b.jar is a unit test library and server for JavaScript</li>
      <li>template_jsTestDriver.cong is a sample of configuration for JsTestDriver</li>
      <li>externs.js is the file containing the declaration extern functions from JsTestDriver, to allow compilation of your test suite in advanced mode with closure</li>
      <li>build-base.xml is the base ant file that you can import</li>
      <li>sample-build.xml is a sample of ant build file for a project. It's almost empty because all the useful stuff is already defined in build-base.xml.</li>
      <li>README.html is this file, handy for presenting the project on github</li>
    </ul>
